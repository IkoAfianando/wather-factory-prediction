- "Data Unavailable" message
- Inconsistent readings between locations

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. **Check Internet Connection**
   - Verify browser can access other websites
   - Test connection speed (minimum 1 Mbps required)
   - Check for firewall or proxy issues

2. **Verify Weather Service Status**
   - Check system status page at `/status`
   - Look for service outage notifications
   - Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

3. **Clear Browser Cache**

   - Disable browser extensions temporarily
   - Try incognito/private browsing mode

4. **Contact Support**
   - If issue persists beyond 30 minutes
   - Provide error messages and browser information
   - Include location and approximate time issue started

#### **Optimization Recommendations Not Appearing**

**Symptoms:**
- Empty recommendations panel
- "No optimizations available" message
- Recommendations appear but with very low confidence

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Insufficient Production Data**
   - System needs minimum 2 weeks of production history
   - Verify production events are being recorded correctly
   - Check that equipment is properly configured in system

2. **Weather Conditions Too Stable**
   - Optimizations only generated when weather impacts production
   - System may not recommend changes during optimal conditions
   - Check historical trends to verify correlation models

3. **Safety Overrides Active**
   - Check if manual overrides are blocking automated recommendations
   - Verify equipment is within operational parameters
   - Review any active maintenance modes

#### **Performance Issues**

**Symptoms:**
- Slow page loading
- Delayed chart updates
- Timeout errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Browser Optimization**
   - Close unnecessary tabs and applications

2. **Network Optimization**
   - Check bandwidth usage by other applications
   - Use wired connection instead of WiFi if possible
   - Contact IT about network congestion

3. **System Resources**
   - Check computer memory usage
   - Close resource-intensive applications
   - Consider using lighter dashboard view

#### **Mobile App Sync Issues**

**Symptoms:**
- Data not syncing between web and mobile
- Missing alerts on mobile
- Actions not reflected across platforms

**Solutions:**
1. **Force Sync**
   - Pull down on mobile dashboard to refresh
   - Log out and back in to reset connection
   - Clear app cache in device settings

2. **Check Permissions**
   - Verify app has necessary permissions
   - Enable background app refresh
   - Check notification settings

3. **Update App**
   - Install latest app version from store
   - Check for pending system updates
   - Restart device if sync issues persist

## Best Practices

### Daily Operation Best Practices

#### **Start of Shift Routine**
1. **Check Weather Overview**
   - Review current conditions at all locations
   - Check 4-hour forecast for changes
   - Note any active alerts or warnings

2. **Review Overnight Activity**
   - Check production performance vs. weather conditions
   - Review any alerts that occurred overnight
   - Verify any parameter changes made by previous shift

3. **Plan for Expected Conditions**
   - Review weather forecast for your shift
   - Pre-position materials if weather changes expected
   - Brief team on expected weather impacts

#### **Throughout Shift Monitoring**
- **Check dashboard every 30 minutes** during normal conditions
- **Monitor continuously** during weather alerts
- **Document all parameter changes** and their outcomes
- **Communicate with other locations** during coordinated weather events

#### **End of Shift Handover**
1. **Document Weather-Related Actions**
   - Parameter changes made and reasons
   - Production impacts observed
   - Any equipment concerns related to weather

2. **Brief Next Shift**
   - Current weather trends
   - Active alerts and their status
   - Expected conditions for next shift
   - Any equipment needing special attention

### Optimization Best Practices

#### **When to Accept AI Recommendations**
- **High confidence (>80%)** with clear weather correlation
- **Historical validation** shows similar conditions and outcomes
- **Equipment is stable** and operating normally
- **No competing priorities** (rush orders, maintenance, etc.)

#### **When to Use Manual Override**
- **Unusual circumstances** not reflected in historical data
- **Equipment-specific issues** known to operator but not in system
- **Material variations** affecting normal parameters
- **Production priorities** requiring different approach

#### **Implementing Changes Gradually**
- **Start with smallest recommended adjustment** (e.g., 10% instead of 20%)
- **Monitor immediate response** before full implementation
- **Make one change at a time** to isolate effects
- **Document results** for future reference

### Maintenance Integration

#### **Weather-Predictive Maintenance**
- **Schedule major maintenance** during optimal weather windows
- **Avoid electrical work** during high humidity periods
- **Plan outdoor work** around weather forecasts
- **Pre-position spare parts** before severe weather

#### **Seasonal Preparation**
- **Spring**: Prepare cooling systems for summer heat
- **Summer**: Focus on dehumidification and cooling efficiency
- **Fall**: Prepare heating systems, check insulation
- **Winter**: Monitor for freeze protection, heating optimization

### Training and Development

#### **New Operator Training**
1. **Week 1**: Shadow experienced operator, observe alert responses
2. **Week 2**: Handle routine alerts with supervision
3. **Week 3**: Independent operation with check-ins
4. **Ongoing**: Monthly weather-production correlation reviews

#### **Continuous Learning**
- **Monthly team meetings** to review weather patterns and learnings
- **Quarterly cross-training** between locations
- **Annual refresher training** on system updates and best practices
- **Knowledge sharing** of successful override decisions

### Performance Optimization

#### **Data Quality Maintenance**
- **Calibrate sensors monthly** or per manufacturer specifications
- **Verify weather data** against multiple sources during critical periods
- **Report data inconsistencies** promptly to IT support
- **Archive old data** according to retention policies

#### **System Performance**
- **Clear browser cache weekly** to maintain performance
- **Update browsers** to latest versions
- **Monitor bandwidth usage** during peak hours
- **Use appropriate dashboard views** for your role and needs

### Emergency Procedures

#### **Severe Weather Response**
1. **Personnel safety first** - follow facility emergency procedures
2. **Secure equipment** according to shutdown procedures
3. **Document weather conditions** and impacts
4. **Communicate with other locations** and management
5. **Prepare for restart** procedures once conditions improve

#### **System Outages**
1. **Switch to manual monitoring** of weather conditions
2. **Use local weather services** for updates
3. **Document manual interventions** for later system sync
4. **Maintain communication** between locations
5. **Implement conservative parameters** when in doubt
